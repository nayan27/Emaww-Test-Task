This submission project assumes you have Docker installed on your machine.

I will admit i hadn't worked with docker for a while so setting things up took some time.

I am not sure i understood what you meant by "Run it with the command export.sh -v /path/to/xml

I simply created a docker-compose project which will run a redis container and a simple javascript application which reads the local config.xml file and inserts the keys in the redis instance.
This project could be way better as you currently can't provide an external config file. I also haven't created any unit tests.

Granted more time, a more complete solution would be elaborate.

Simply run the following command to start containers and execute the application.
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d
